@@12747081 @1347081/ <h> Plural Possessives : Why You Put an Apostrophe After the S <p> Its common for people to wonder , " What does it mean to put an apostrophe after an S ? " It can get a bit confusing . To get it right , you need to understand what a possessive is . <p> Possessives are used to show ownership ; to show that something belongs to someone . " The presidents official airplane " is one example . The airplane belongs to the president , of course . But there is only one president ; after all , you do n't  have two presidents of the same country . So , this is a singular possessive made by adding an apostrophe and an " s . " <p> But with a phrase such as " the thieves jewels , " you have a plural noun : thieves . Most of the time , a plural noun will be formed by adding " s " to it . In this case , you also change the spelling but do n't  worry about that now . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Houses , cats , clouds , essays , rainbows : these are all plural nouns . <p> As you can see , the fact that the thieves ( illegally ) possess the jewels is shown simply by adding an apostrophe after the noun and after the letter " s . " They may not possess these valuables for long unless they 're clever and know how to escape the police , but they do for now . And that 's how you form a plural possessive . <p> To recap , usually if the noun is singular , the apostrophe will go before the s , but if the noun happens to be plural , the apostrophe will go after the s . <h> Plural Possessive Examples <p> The Simpsons spaceship ( the spaceship belongs to the Simpson family ; you make the family name plural to show that you 're referring to all of the family members ) <p> The dogs tails ( the tails belong to the dogs ) <p> The lakes water ( the water belongs to the lakes ) <p> You have to be careful with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lake , you must write : " the lakes water . " In this case , that 's a singular possessive . <p> An even bigger problem these days is when people write sentences such as this : " None of the monkeys looked happy in the zoo . " There is no reason to use an apostrophe to make a possessive here . The sentence is only talking about monkeys in the plural . They do not own anything ! However , this is a commonly repeated mistake across the Internet . <p> Sometimes its hard to see how the possessive works . " You owe me three months pay immediately ! " Oh , I do ? Let me check my wallet . And my grammar guide . Why is there an apostrophe after " months ? " Because the pay is equal to three months of work . In a sense , the pay belongs to those three months . Its like saying " three months of pay . " If you can use the word " of " in the sentence , then you probably need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 've learned all the rules , you 're in for a surprise . There 's another type of plural possessive : the irregular plural possessive . The childrens work was so poorly done that the teacher fainted and had to go to the hospital . Okay , this might not really happen , but I used to be a teacher , and sometimes I felt like fainting ! <p> The main point is this . " Children " is already plural . You can not add " s " to the word itself to make it plural . So when you want to show possession , you put the apostrophe first , then the " s . " Here are some more examples . <p> The womens babies ( " women " is the plural form of " woman " ) <p> The firemens trucks ( " firemen " is the plural of " fireman " ) <p> The dices roll ( " dice " always means there is more than one ) <p> These look like singular possessives , but they are n't  . <h> Compound Plural Possessives <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural possessives , but there 's one more rule you need to know . It deals with compound plural possessives . For example , " Sam and Dave " is a compound . There are two parts . So which of the following is correct ? <p> Sam and Daves song was number one for six months . <p> Sams and Daves song was number one for six months . <p> The correct one is the first . Why ? Because Sam and Dave made or performed the song together . It belongs to both of them . Only one possessive needs to be given . But you need to be careful . <p> Lucys and Ginas cars are the fastest on my street . <p> Micks and Rods views on equal rights are impressive . <p> In these two examples , you need two possessives , one for each proper noun . Lucy and Gina both have different cars . Mick and Rod have separate views . However , what if Lucy and Gina were mother and daughter , and both of them had the same cars ? Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars are the fastest on my street . " <p> With compound plural possessives , its important to remember you have to think a little and decide whether you are talking about two separate people or things , or a single unit with two parts . <h> 4 comments <p> Hey , my name is Heiko . I came here because I did n't  know what plural possessive meant when reading it in my grammar book . Its good that there is a clear explanation like this to help people like me . Thank you ! <p> This has always been quite confusing for me . Especially when the word already ends in an " s " I never know what to do with it . It even gets worse when words and in two " ss " I think that there should be a better way to indicate possessive than with an apostrophe since that 's used for conjunctions .
